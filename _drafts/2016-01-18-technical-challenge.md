## Format To Demonstrate Higher Value

On this project, here's a problem I encountered. Here's what I've done to solve it, and here's the skill I demonstrated while solving this problem.

In addition, here's another situation in which I solved a different problem, or a similar problem during which I demonstrated a similar skill. 

This is to show that I possess this valuable skill, and am a desirable candiate.

What impact did my actions have? 
ie. The products I worked on shipped and earned x-amount of revenue.
We gained a foot hold in x company that enabled future businesses

## What Am I Good At?

* Problem Solving
* Connecting the Dots
* Attention to Detail

### Problem Solving:
At my last job, on the lab project I worked on, I designed a comprehensive upgrade package to an existing product, and thereby extending its functionality and greatly reducing the risk of designing a brand new product from the ground up.

## Resume Writing

Avoid writing "An app that", or "a web app that"

Privide context for what you were working on
Do not include technologies in the project description

1. What did you build? 
2. How did you build it?
3.What was the outcome?

Be specific 

Do not specify specifics of the app, but more the the technology, the what, how, and outcome

Talk about accomplishments, not responsibilities
