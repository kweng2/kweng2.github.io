### A conflict I ran into while working on a group:

While working on implementing Avalon as a web app, we struggled to get the ball rolling, and seemed lost on how to start. We dove into the coding and as a group felt direction-less without a clear leader and outline.

### Details about the group project:

We intended to make a web app that automatically assigns roles, counts votes, advance the quests etc, on multiple clients using the MEAN stack with web sockets. The game is still intended to be played in person.

### What the problem was:

Being a complex game, we had a tough time figuring out how the game would progress, game architecture, io's between the front-end and back-end. For example, at a certain state, who needs what information, and how does that information need to pass between the client and the server. Then, how would the game state advance. As we started trying to write code, we didn't know what to put down, or where to start.

### And how I recognized the problem:

As we were discussing the details, such as naming conventions, I realized that we didn't have a clearly outlined bigger picture. And more importantly, we had a leadership vacuum.

### How we solved the problem:

I then proposed we white board the game logic decision tree, and from there, white board the communication architecture between clients and server. That helped us immensionly in the following days.

### What I learned in the process:

I learned one way a leader-vacuum can manifest itself.
I learned how to step up as a leader while not knowing everything myself
I learned the importance and value of whiteboarding and planning prior to starting a project

### Why that's important:

Explicitly whiteboarding the architecture ensures that all group members are on the same page and eliminates confusions later down the line.
Establishing this outline helps us understand what challenges we face, what we needed to learn, and ultimately how to divide labor, which morphs our team into an effective group.
