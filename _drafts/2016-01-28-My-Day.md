Debugged a redis BLPOP callback hell.
Was calling BLPOP before the popped action finished, so the action doesn't finish.

Made a room queueing system, aka match-making system in sockets.

Debugged a socket id problem. Needed '/#' in front of the identifying string.

Yesterday, we wrote redis queues on a seperate server that pops and pushes

Build a dockerfile for each image, in our case:

1. server
1. worker
1. postgres

In the postgres dockerfile, we need to create a user and a password, by first login in as the user 'postgres.' Then create a database with NAME In the postgres connection definition, probably under knex stuff, update the user, password, and database with the appropriate parameters

Build a docker-compose yml file that links everything together
Make sure nothing is running
Run ```docker-compose up -d```

Now check out the fruit of our labour!

To deploy to Digital Ocean, do the following:
1. Create a digital ocean droplet:
``` $ docker-machine create --driver digitalocean --digitalocean-access-token=PERSON-ACCESS-TOKEN NAME-OF-APP ```

2. Run ```docker-machine ls```, expect to see NAME-OF-APP listed as a machine
3. Point the docker-machine to NAME-OF-APP ```dkme NAME-OF-APP```
4. Run ```docker-machine ssh NAME-OF-APP```
5. Run ```docker-compose up -d```
6. Profit


Figuring out tail-call recursion

Docker and postgres, use the env variable to create and set username, password, and db name

Pair arena complete

Ready button fix

Leave room behavior fix
